					 <p>STEM is an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. According to the United States National Research Council and the National Science Foundation, STEM fields are collectively considered core technological underpinnings of an advanced society. The term STEM is increasingly used in the context of a nationâ€™s economic competitiveness. Thus STEM education not only addresses the demand for scientists and engineers, but also is a key component of responsible, global citizenship.</p>

					<p>To be competitive in the global economy, to pursue an aggressive yet sustainable development, STEM Center USA prepares our younger generation to embrace creativity, invention and innovation. STEM is the engine that can power this growth. STEM education begins in early childhood when children are curious and creative and continues through college. All children, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, or learning style, can excel in STEM disciplines and can aspire to STEM careers. Effective teaching at all levels utilizes hands-on, minds-on inquiry into the natural world. STEM Center USA offers comprehensive STEM education for P-16 market (preschool through college) using a Guided Discovery Approach.</p>

					<p>We believe that true learning takes place when a student has an opportunity to discover on their own through a hands-on, experiential, learning model. By allowing children to be involved in a learning process that excites, energizes, engages and enriches them to a wide variety of skills and concepts, they will discover a path that will enable them to have a more productive education.</p>

					<p>Our STEM education program has been the culmination of more than 15 years of research and application experience by Dr. Jawa, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at California State Polytechnic University (Cal Poly Pomona), Pomona in California, U.S. Dr. Jawa has been developing and implementing engaging STEM activities since 1993 in Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and California. Since joining Cal Poly Pomona, Dr. Jawa founded the well known Robot Rally initiative, which has become a National Model and being adopted in various countries including India and China.</p>
